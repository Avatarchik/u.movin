## Unity animated vector graphics created from After Effects shape compositions.

Inspired by the [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web) frameworks that take animation data from After Effects to create animated vector sequences on web/mobile platforms, with the help of the [Vector Graphics](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.vectorgraphics@1.0/manual/index.html) package this library aims to bring the equivalent to Unity.

## Features

While still preliminary and not yet utilizing all attributes and properties, this framework currently supports animation for: 

- Shape paths
- Shape fill color
- Shape stroke color
- Layer position
- Layer rotation (X, Y, Z)
- Layer scale
- Layer opacity 
- Single layer precompositions (underway)
