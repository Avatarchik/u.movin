## Create animated vector graphics from After Effects shape compositions.

Inspired by the [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-web) frameworks that take animation data from After Effects to create animated vector sequences on web/mobile platforms, with the help of the [Vector Graphics](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.vectorgraphics@1.0/manual/index.html) package this library aims to bring the equivalent to Unity.

This framework is still early and doesn't utilize every After Effects attribute and property yet, but includes proper keyframe interpolation and currently supports: 

- Shape path
- Shape fill color
- Shape stroke color
- Layer position
- Layer rotation (X, Y, Z)
- Layer scale
- Layer opacity
